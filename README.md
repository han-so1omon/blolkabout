Blolkabout - Take a hike

## Why is this empty?

This is using the [Streamr Core app](https://streamr.network/core)

I was getting some errors deploying my Product / Data Union

```
No Contract found at 0xd0B3a09A6bCee8446d10e6E7e12c78F8725C9B18, check DataUnionClient.options.dataUnion.factoryAddress!
```

If I can fix this, then I'll work on the webapp and continue updating

## What is the point of this app?

I have a lot of hippie friends, and outdoorsy folks in general. They like to hike, but sometimes don't find the energy or time to do so because it can seem like a waste or a lot to go through. I'm sure some of them would love to have an extra buck or two in their pocket. Likewise, I think there's some cool use cases for the data sets, e.g.:

- Geolocation stuff, including AR
- Robotics stuff, including Boston Dynamics Atlas training / tracking or Tesla auto-pickup
- Health studies

-- This early concept version uses a datastream from [Strava data](https://strava.com) --


## How do I find the Data Union

Perhaps [here](https://streamr.network/core/products/fa3ebd041b3a4acaa62f2bdcb66d53ae564e7e154f3e4dd3afdb44602a188580/), although I think it is only a draft for now, which either has to do with the failure to deploy earlier or the membership minimum
